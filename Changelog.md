## Changelog
- By Hipreme/MrcSnm:

##### jcnmsg/LOVE-WrapLua (WIP)
- Added love.graphics.polygon and love.graphics.triangle support to OneLua and partial support to lpp-vita ("line" mode only)
- Added love.math.triangulate

### OneLua/PS_Vita Only
- Support most of love.graphics functions 
- touch.lua and mouse.lua added 
- Added command for resetting (Hold LEFT, UP, SQUARE, TRIANGLE, L and press R)
- Support for quads, global scale and offset
- Added printf function for right, left and center alignment
- Backwards WrapLua compatibility
- Now it supports love2d objects (Now you can call imageInstance:getWidth() etc)
- Added some do-nothing functions for not breaking code compatibility with desktop version
- Correctly replaced 'require' function
- Added callbacks onResume and onLiveArea

### Needing
- Rotated text
- Blend modes
- Shader support
- Tint blit for everything
- Better image.blit for quads

#### Known Issues
- Calling screen.textwidth(font, text, size) will make the font passed on the argument to blur, the current workaround is creating a clone e.g loading the same font 2 times and then using the guinea pig to get the text width
- Calling image.blit() for a resized image quad will mantain the texture size, the current workaround is loading a image copy with image.copyscale() for the size needed, it will cache this resized image until it's scale is changed, the problem is that it will lag a bit when caching, don't know to what extent this is possible, and doing scale animations with images from quad is really inusable
- The only supported audio that didn't crash the engine was mp3 at a 44100 sample rate, wav file didn't crash, but sounded strange, need more tests



#### OneLua Wrong Documentations
- screen.textheight -> Actually receiving (string) instead receiving (userdata, number), actually returning 20 no matter what, the Y offset = 18.5
- image.setfilter -> Actually receives a image and the 2 types (image, number, number), image, mag, min

##### EXTRA
- Tool for sending every type of file for Linux, called fastCurl, just call
```sh
./fastCurl.sh "filetype"
```
- Type only the filetype, without the ".", it will send recursively every "filetype" from the folder inside ./homebrew, it will send defaultly to ftp://192.168.15.19:1337/ux0:/ONELUAHP0/, change it to your needings, if you cancel while sending the files, enter in the directory of fastCurl and delete the cache .txt files
- Added a tool to convert your audio files recursively instantly, it just requires 'sox' command from shelll, you can find it here: http://sox.sourceforge.net/
- The usage is the same as fastCurl, it won't delete your original audio files, it will create a copy to the supported filetype to vita, the usage is the same and the filetype can be overridden to the "filetype" you specify, the default type is mp3
- A tool for deleting your audios, it is defaulted to only remove mp3 files, there is no confirm button, so take care
